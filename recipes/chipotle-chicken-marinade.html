    <p>This recipe is not intended to taste like the Chipotle restaurant chicken. It is named this because of the use of chipotle peppers in the dish. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs chicken (breasts, thighs, drums, tenders)</li>
        <li>4 tbs olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbs honey</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 tbs cilantro</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
        <li>4-5 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add all ingredients into a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour over chicken</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        I think this recipe tastes best when the chicken is grilled and you can get a nice char on it. For that reason I often like to use thighs because they are cheap and hard to overcook.<br><br>
         ***EDIT***<br>
        I suggested using chipotle peppers in adobo (I use the La Costena brand) but it is not required. You can find recipes online to make your own adobo sauce at home and you can also experiment with using other peppers in this dish. You may also find recipes for Filipino. The word adobo comes from the Spanish word adobar meaning “marinade” or “pickling sauce”. Filipino adobo uses lots of vinegar so they associated the tangy flavor with their own adobo. You can find a more in depth explanation here:
